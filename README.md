LAPWING 2.2 is a multi-purpose flight computer custom-built for the Avionics team of UQ Space. 

Among a plethora of features, it has onboard data storage, a range of sensors equivalent to 10-DOF (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and barometer), 3.3V and 5V power, expansion capability through the GPIO terminals and 2 high-current low-side MOSFET switches (ie. the e-match circuit).
